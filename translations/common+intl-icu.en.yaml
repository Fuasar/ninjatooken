        Hi {username},

        NinjaTooken is back since almost two months now!
        Your humble servant did his best to make the game funier than ever:
        - network delay removed... a hit is a hit,
        - "walk on water" is available to everyone, and Suitons have a brand new jutsu: "aqueous transformation",
        - redesign of the game interface, for a greater experience on big screen,
        - correction of bugs, for more stability,
        - reduced chakra costs and performance of some jutsus, for more balance in the game,
        - and obviously the update to the latest version of the game engine.

        Everything is hosted on a brand new dedicated server.

        To play now and discover all those improvements, log in here {autologin} and then download the game (available on windows and macOS).

        And don't forget to reset your password.

    description: |
        If you played the game some years ago, you surely expect to see it been shown right here.<br>
        But yeah, <a href='https://unity3d.com/webplayer%20' target='_blank'>Unity doesn't support the web player anymore</a> (and it's not a recent issue).<br>
        As the game is working on the last Unity version (2021), it requires a WebGL's export and adapting the code of the game...<br>
        I lack spare time for this, so I suggest you to download and execute the game on your favorite OS (those are standalones, no installation required):<br>
        <h1>Current version : {version}</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><h1><a href="/windows{version}.zip" target="_blank">Windows</a></h1></li>
            <li>
                <h1><a href="/mac{version}.zip" target="_blank">MacOS</a></h1>
                For the mac version, the game may not launch. You must then open the terminal and then:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>cd &lt;PATH_TO_YOUR_APP&gt;/ninjatooken.app/Contents/MacOS/</code><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>chmod +x ninjatooken.app</code><br>
                if this chmod is not enough to make the game executable:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>sudo chmod -R 755</code><br>
                It is possible that even if the game is well executable, the build version differs too much and that it is still impossible to launch it ... I have no solution right now for this :/ 
                </li>
        </ul>
